💬 What Is a Spotify Countdown Page?
Picture a digital backstage pass, set just for your release day. That’s your Spotify Countdown Page. It’s a limited time landing page for your upcoming single or album that lets fans:

Know exactly when the drop hits.
Pre-save your project so it automatically lands in their libraries.
Get a taste of exclusive visuals, teasers, or behind-the-scenes feels you’ve designed.
Receive a notification the moment the music launches.
It’s like your digital release party: your fans are invited, they RSVP, and they’re here for the big night.

🔨 How to Set One Up And Smarten It Up
Getting started is easy but you need to qualify first. Spotify currently opens this feature to artists who have:

At least 1,000 followers
A trusted digital distributor connected to Spotify for Artists
Once you’re in, here’s how to make your page pop:

🔗 Link it to your upcoming release via Spotify for Artists.
📸 Add visuals or teaser clips that tell your release story.
📬 Share it right away. Social media, newsletters etc.
📣 Push pre-saves early. The sooner fans hit that button, the stronger the pre-release energy.

Drive people there early, and you’ll be riding momentum straight into launch day.

🤝 Press Coverage + Groover = Countdown Page on Fire
Here’s the real power move: a Countdown Page without visibility is just a pretty countdown. You need eyes and Spotify’s algorithm is watching. That’s where Groover steps in.

You might already know the drill: with Groover, you pitch your upcoming release directly to music curators, journalists, radio DJs, and playlist editors. Every mention, article, or playlist drop isn’t just extra hype, it’s proof to the algorithm that your sound matters. The more referral points online, the more Spotify trusts your release. So don’t let your page float alone. Back it with Groover powered coverage and make it impossible to ignore.



🤔 Should You Use a Spotify Countdown Page?
Yes, if you’re ready for lift-off! 

Got a fanbase? Great, Countdown Pages help you measure and build pre-save hype.
Growing? This is where professional polish meets attention grabbing strategy.
Want algorithmic love? This is one more signal that you’re not just noise.
Even for indie artists with small budgets, it’s more than just a digital flagship, it’s your release’s first impression.

💡Little Tip: Turn Launches into Events
A Spotify Countdown Page won’t change your artist career overnight but paired with Groover? It becomes the opening act to your release party, long before the music plays. Use the page. Fill it with your story. Boost its impact with press and curators.

Ready to flex that strategy muscle? Set it up. Pitch it. Launch your release like the celebration it should be.
