écrit par Sofija 24 July 2025

For artists who work alone, live shows are still maybe the best means of gaining not just exposure, but confidence, common circle, and fan attachment. But in a time with so much online content, algorithms, and closed social circles, getting gigs can be intimidating. So we figured little tips to help you get into it could be beneficial to upgrade your career!

🎤 Why Live Shows Still Matter
Live performances aren’t a marketing strategy. They’re one of the only times when you can get people “in the moment”. Playing live lets you: 

Test your songs in front of real ears 
Create deep bonds in your tribe 
Create raw, dynamic content 
Build an audience that connects with you, not just your music 
And let’s be real 👉 word of mouth starts here.

🛠️ How french toast Got Their First Gigs
We also interviewed french toast, an up-and-coming pop duo, who shared how they started performing, not by “luck” or by spamming dozens of venues, but by gradually finding their place in the scene.


“We started off by going to shows. To listen, but also to be part of the atmosphere,” they explain. “We’d talk to artists after, ask questions, share how their music moved us. It wasn’t about hoping to get something out of it, it was about learning, connecting, and realizing that you don’t need to be Billie Eilish playing in a huge arena to put on a great show.”

For them, it wasn’t about landing gigs right away, but about absorbing the energy of the indie scene, exchanging tips about gear, building confidence, and seeing firsthand how many different ways there are to make music live.

Many of their early performances weren’t in traditional venues either.
“Some of our first sets happened in creative shops, small listening sessions, or community events run by local indie businesses. They weren’t massive, but they mattered. People actually listened.”

For french toast, collaborating with other artists and joining mixed lineups helped them grow their audience, little by little.
“When you’re the opener, you’re playing in front of someone else’s crowd. If five people connect with your music that night, that’s five more than yesterday. That’s how it starts.”

🎯 6 Actionable Tips to Book More Shows
Submerge Yourself in the Situation
Go to 2–3 local shows every week. See it through to the end. Mingle with musicians. Say hi to whoever is running sound. The majority of opportunity is a result of being seen and remembered.

Reach Out to Artists, Not Just Venues
Opening is often a breeze in comparison to convincing a venue to book you as a headliner yourself. DM these acts you enjoy, and volunteer to open, co-host, or help with promo.

Target Alternative Spaces
💬Think:

Music stores or bookstores that host community nights
Café or rooftop live sets
DIY venues, studios, even living room shows
They are more embracing and more receptive to outsiders.

Assemble a Basic Live Pack
Keep it short and sweet:

2-sentence bio
1-2 short live video clips (filmed even with your smartphone)
References to your songs and social media 
1 explicit request: “We’d like to play a 30 mins set at your next event”
Host a Small Party Yourself
No gatekeepers, just good vibes and mutual promotion. It fosters trust – and generates content and traction.

Remember the Snowball Effect
Your very first show may be to 10 individuals. But that 10th person could be another artist, a journalist, a curator, or just a person who brings 5 friends back next time. The problem is getting going.
