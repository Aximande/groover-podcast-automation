Why Press Placements matter more than ever in the age of AI Search
écrit par Sofija 15 September 2025

Listening to music isn’t like the old days. People searching for music don’t just input the name of an artist and press go. Thanks to AI search tools (Hi ChatGPT) and smarter streaming recommendations, people now search things like “new R&B singers with a retro vibe” or “indie artists like Dua Lipa.”

These days, getting noticed as an artist isn’t just about the streams of your tracks or the number of your online fans. It is also about the frequency at which you get mentioned online, which (not to repeat myself) demonstrates the importance of the press.

📣 Press Coverage = Algorithmic Visibility
Think of every blog review, magazine feature, or online article as your digital business card. These mentions aren’t just for humans, they’re for the machines too. The way AI works is by scanning the web. If you don’t appear in its searches, it simply doesn’t see you and to the algorithm, that means you don’t exist. No recommendations, no visibility. On the flip side, if your name pops up everywhere, AI will recognize you and start mentioning you. The more mentions you have, the higher you’ll show up on its list. In short: AI is your new SEO.


🤝 From Human Validation to Machine Validation
Press used to be mostly about human validation: fans, curators, or industry pros reading about you in respected outlets. That still matters. But now? Every piece of coverage also feeds the algorithm.

Picture two artists with similar music. One has no press, the other has a few blog reviews and a local magazine feature. When someone asks an AI for “emerging artists in neo soul”, guess who shows up? The one the machine can see.

🎯 Building a Smart Press Strategy
 Don’t chase every outlet. Be intentional. It takes 3 steps to create a  good press strategy:

1️⃣ Target outlets that already match your genre and audience.
2️⃣ Personalize your pitch so it feels authentic.
3️⃣ Share the story behind your music, not just the release date.

Platforms like Groover make this way easier by connecting you with journalists and bloggers who are actively looking for fresh sounds. No more blind emails, real conversations with people who want to hear you.

👀 So How Can We Help?
Here’s the good news: you don’t have to do it alone. Groover closes the distance between performers and the media industry. Rather than taking the time to cold email disinterested bloggers, you can pitch your work directly to writers, playlist curators, radio stations, and labels that are eager to discover new talent.The best part? You’re guaranteed feedback. Whether it’s a feature, a playlist spot, or just thoughtful advice, every connection helps you grow and adds another trace of your name online!

❄️ The Snowball Effect
Press multiplies. One feature often leads to another. Journalists discover you through other articles, playlist curators trust you more when they see press mentions, booking agents pay attention when your name is circulating online. Most importantly, algorithms start recognizing you as relevant. Each article = a new data point boosting your long-term visibility.

🚀 Bottom Line
If we had to sum up everything, we’ll just say that in the age of AI search, press isn’t just an ego boost, it’s survival. The music industry is intertwined with the tech industry, which means it inevitably evolves at the same pace as tech itself. Without it, you risk blending into the noise of millions of weekly uploads. With it, you carve out a presence that makes you discoverable by fans, curators, and even AI. So for your next release, don’t forget to ask yourself: Where will people (and algorithms) find me?
